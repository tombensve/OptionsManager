The markdown (.md) is the main source for the documentation. The PDF is created by:

- Generating HTML.
- Viewing that HTML in Google Chrome (Safari does not work!, Firefox I haven't tried).
- Selecting all text in the browser and copying it.
- Pasting into an Open Office .odt document (I use Neo Office on Mac).
- Inserting a "Table of Contents" at the top.
- Inserting page number in the footer.
- Export as PDF.

I do this instead of using markdown to PDF tools just to get the table of contents
for which there is no markdown way of providing.

The problem with safari is that when you copy the rendered HTML from safari you get
just plain text with headers being different font size, while when copied from Chrome
the headers are actually headers. The no-header safari copy means no table of contents
can be generated.
